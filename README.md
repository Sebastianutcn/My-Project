# My-Project
Here I want to share with you my first java project

This is a FINA Points Calculator which helps swimmers to calculate and evaluate their times.

The FINA Points Table allows comparisons of results among different events. The FINA Point Scoring assigns point values to swimming performances, more points for world class performances typically 1000 or more and fewer points for slower performances.

Point values are assigned every year. The charts have one set of points for Short Course and another for Long Course.
